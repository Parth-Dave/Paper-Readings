# COordinate Rotation Dlgital Computer(CORDIC)

Use of trigonometric rotation properties to get fast digital trigonometric function

sin(a+b) = sina cosb + cosa sinb

cos(a+b) = cosa cosb - sina sinb

taking cos b common 

sin(a+b) = cos(b) (sina + cosa tanb)

cos(a+b) = cos (b) ( cos a - sina tanb)

using these properties of rotation we can get a destination rotation starting with any angle 

here lets say a is initial rotation and a+b is desitnation angle , hence we rotate by angle b

if we take b such a way that b= tan^-1 (2^-n) , by doing so the 2nd term of rotation becomes a left shift and for increasing values of n , b decreases hence it will converge to a the destination over iterations.

so for a N iteration implementation we can store N values of b=tan^-1(2^-n) for N = 0,1,2....,N-1

here x is cos value,y is sin value , i is iteration and z is current difference needed to destination rotation, sigma is sign of rotation (a+b or a-b) 

sign is selected by a check of sign of z[i], if positive then sign is 1 else -1 

note that we are ignoring the term of cos(b) from before , that is because for a fixed number of iteration the product of cos(b) will be always constant (scaling factor) and hence it can be multiplied at the end

due to the scaling factor we need to run the circuit for all iteration even if we are getting z[i]= destination angle inbetween as even if angle is same the values will differ because we are taking the scaling factor for a particular number of iterations

by this method the final architecture can be reduced to just shifters, adders and Registers or LUTs
